I guess it would be really nice to do it more often.","Perhaps is too complex, but i would like a ""cross platform"" tutorial. i.e at the end of the day we have the same problems but we use different softwares based on our preferences. So I guess that something like this coud be interesting: Problem: ""I want to segment cells with cellpose"" and do a tutorial with FIJI, CellProfiler,  QuPath, Napari and Python. In other cases, do tutorials using the power of the different softwares tooguether for example:   okay I can do this segementation in QuPath, then I export the tiles and mask using this script and I can use Cellprofiler to extract morphological data. This kind of tutorials could be really usefull. ","I guess that It would be good to have online sessions once every 3-5 months. To ask to the comunity some feedback with the programs or ask for preferences of the users. Perhaps sometimes the users think why something is not present in the program and perhaps the developers have never realized that it was a ""problem"".","I guess that we mainly share our questions, but we barely comment the results or the problems that we have. I guess that if it could be possible to share more the specific ""case"", so share the initial problem, the different options to handle the problem, and the final solution or proposal to that problem, can be really nice. Perhaps there is a paper or a prerprint, but do some kind of anouncement or video explaining it could be nice","I think that more ""human"" interaction could be nice. Perhaps do ""The month of X software"". So that month do a long post or an online meeting doing a summary of the questions related with that software in the last months. Perhaps add info about what the developers are working on and have some discussion could be nice. We cannot read all the posts, so those summaries could be really nice","My last thought, but it is a little bit more complex, is to do a category for Pytorch. It is one of the most used frameworks nowadays. There is already a pytorch forum, but one specific in image analysis would be really nice. Perhaps to put some basic tutorials, and increasing a little bit more the complexity, or to put resources.

There are too many tools being developed at the same time by many people. In some cases these are repeated. It would be great to have and encourage people to discuss, share or even collaborate instead of making a new tool. Zulip and image.sc have done quite a good job at letting people discuss and work together in these aspects.","Actually, I haven't gone through many options of image.sc and I now notice my suggestions are likely implemented already. I remember having some bot guided ""getting started"", but it would have been great to know I could join groups with shared interests and probably some examples of the categories.","There has been a lot of hype around deep learning related tools, and these are really good. I think we are lacking discussions on how to estimate errors of our algorithms (which are probably very tricky for DL). I would love to have more discussions surrounding microscope characterization and how to do the image corrections of these things (illumination, background, registration, pincushion,etc). I'm happy to see that lots of people are gathering to discuss quality and what is the minimum level of quality to expect. I would love editors and journals to address these suggestions, and in my opinion, it would be good to have them have some minimum run of shared analysis in images (even something similar to GitHub actions should work).",Faculty/Staff,Non Trainee,Analyst,High Skill,High Comfort,Highly Manual,Life Sciences,Yes

Often time controls required are missing (channel alignment with beads). They don't understand the garbage in-garbage out principle and often are pressed to generate result faster, so they don't have time to learn things in a proper way. Image quality is under appreciated. I think we need to educate people more on good practices for image quality and data analysis. 

For AI, I see a lot of users use deep learning where machine learning would have been totally fine, but it's so trendy to say deep learning... Also, no quality control or good practices here, which worries me a lot and I tend to not trust results because the info for reproducibility is lacking. 

People tend to just want to click, they don't want to understand how things work. They just want results. I think it's a cultural problem. 

I fear that the ""user friendly"" interfaces has profoundly changed understanding of image analysis and has changed the appreciation of image analysts in general. The same trend is pushed by companies with image acquisition. It si ever user friendlier to the point that it's just click-click and there is an image.

If the cumulative errors are less than ~20% of the expected difference between groups that will typically be good enough. When possible I try to do the same analysis on a different image coming from the same sample (eg. tissue scanned twice on the slide scanner). This help to get a feeling for the amount of variability that is introduced by different steps of the workflow. I rely on visual checks at major analysis milestones and look whether the numbers I get at the end make sense visually when I get back to my images. I sometimes do the analysis with different levels of stringency (for example, looking at collagen in tissue and setting up threshold to find only the most positive fibers vs being more liberal and capturing also the weakly stained ones), and trying to see if my settings are changing the outcome of the analysis. In most cases, the general trend is preserved regardless of the parameters, but if it's not then I dig deeper and try to understand why this is happening.

I think there is a lot of overview material already, but getting more into how to deal with different artifacts, work across larger datasets, fine-tune the analysis for particular types of studies would be very valuable. I would like to learn more about spatial analysis (clustering, non-random distribution of objects) in the context of the tissue - where we have natural boundaries and how to deal with them.

I think it was because a lot of different open source software owners gave talks about features in their programs and how to use them.,Tutorials - yes. Typically when I'm looking for a tutorial it's because I have a problem that needs solving. I am more motivated to learn how to do something when I have a dataset that requires it.,The conferences I get to attend are quite random but I was surprised that there was nothing about image analysis at SfN. Many of the people who visited my poster had never heard of Cell Profiler even though they were interested in HCA. Perhaps this is because they're using whatever software is natively available on their instrument but there are some questions that are better answered elsewhere.,"There are still many tools I am not aware of - for instance I just learned about https://bioimage.io/ from this survey. I really appreciate talks that introduce the basics of available open source tools (use cases, basics on how to use).",I appreciate that tools are open source and frequently open education (for instance both QuPath and Cell Profiler have amazing documentation). Sometimes it's hard to know what's available and how I can use it in my work - I think when you have a tool it's important to make people aware of it and then to keep supporting it or hand it off to someone else for continued support.,"I think users are intimidated to try unfamiliar things. I have to push my reports to explore image analysis tools because they frequently prefer to perform manual analysis or give me a descriptive result. While it's faster once to do things manually, it's faster and more accurate in the long run to use a tool. We need to shift expectations for imaging data - if people are allowed to publish with just descriptive images then that will be the path of least resistance for most microscope users.",I think forum.image.sc is working well.,I appreciate how open and supportive the image analysis community is. It's nice that there are online seminars and conferences as well as meetup groups at certain conferences.

It would be so great to take any style of brightfield/DIC/phase contrast image and have it make regions of interest around the cells so I can easily and quickly determine cell size (e.g. feret diameter), buds, etc. I can do it by eye I have seen that YeastMate exists and have thought about using other ML options, but those require something like a Python virtual environment, which I could not figure out how to set up! It feels like there's a big barrier for me for using these powerful ML tools.

In the past, I have worked with mammalian cells and tissue. Finding nuclei is not super well solved imo in tissues where cells and their nuclei can be very packed together (or I never found the right solution). There are areas of hyperproliferative kidney tubule epithelium, for example, where nuclei look like they are overlapping even in a 5 µm section.

Currently, with my yeast, I'm looking at granules made visible by FP tags and epifluorescence microscopy (later confocal/superres, probably). Many cells have fluorescence at the granule but also elsewhere, with sometimes high ""background"" (diffuse) signal sometimes not. The other fluorescent features may be brighter than my granule, e.g. there may be a cytoplasmic granule of similar or less intensity than the average nuclear intensity. I would like to count the granules and also measure at their size without doing it manually. Bonus if I can pair it with that ROI identifier without drawing borders around all of the cells and an ML program can identify number of granules per cell. It seems to defy basic automated tools like local maximum, intensity, etc, even after some blurring or other filters and standard fiji adjustment options (I'm not an expert, clearly).","It's never good enough, haha. But really, it's good enough (for now) when it achieves the measurement needed without taking too long to figure out the workflow. For example, if it takes longer to automate something than to do it manually, manually is good enough (not true over the long-term, perhaps).",No tools,No tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Twitter / X,Conference session on imaging or image analysis,"Twitter / X, Other social media, Email list",,,,I would like to know how to set up a python virtual environment and use it to analyse any image.,"Somehow helping novices do the basic things needed before even installing/opening the tool they made.

For example, recommend that when a tool is published, enough good quality documentation should be available. Also a stadardized format could be agreed on, so developers do not have to reinvent the wheel when creating the documentation. ","I think the best way of improving image analysis from microscopists is to have guidelines for checking and reporting staining quality and for image acquisition.

When I feel that an automated pipeline is more error-prone than my own identification, I WILL scrap the automation. I tried some image analysis courses but I found them too willing to accept subpar processing accuracy (esp. related to dendrite tracing or tissue segmentation) in favour of promoting 'simple' or 'fully automated' solutions. Such an approach is valid when one has 20,000 images, but when when one has 200. Often these courses also work with the most beautiful and easy-to-analyse images, talking about best case scenario use cases instead of helping actual wet lab scientists troubleshoot their pipelines. Not every antibody will have a beautiful signal-to-noise ratio and this needs to be accepted as a sometimes necessary reality instead of shoved under the carpet.

In order to evaluate my pipeline I need to have easy and convenient way to double-check every step of analysis/segmentation as performed on each tissue sample, both while the analysis occurs and with an option to come back and double-check when the analysis is finished.
