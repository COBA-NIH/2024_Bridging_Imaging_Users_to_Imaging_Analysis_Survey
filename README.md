# 2024 Bridging Imaging Users to Imaging Analysis Survey

Survey supported by the [Center for Open Bioimage Analysis (COBA)](https://openbioimageanalysis.org), [BioImaging North America (BINA)](https://www.bioimagingnorthamerica.org), [Royal Microscopy Society(RMS)](https://www.rms.org.uk), and [Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBias)](https://www.globias.org/home).

This repository contains the [raw survey questions](data/survey_questions.pdf), [raw survey responses](data/raw_responses.csv), and [cleaned survey responses](data/cleaned_responses.csv) that were cleaned with code in [0_Clean_Data.ipynb](0_Clean_Data.ipynb).

Some very preliminary data exploration was done using the Jupyter notebooks in the repository with example figures output to the [figures folder](/figures).
Please note that because these figures were for preliminary analysis, we suggest further refinements be made to most figures before using in presentations, publications, etc.

The data in this repository are not associated with a publication.
Surveys from previous years were published - see [2020 survey repository](https://github.com/ciminilab/2021_Jamali_BiologicalImaging) and [2020 survey paper](http://doi.org/10.1017/S2633903X21000039), and [2022 survey repository](https://github.com/COBA-NIH/2023_ImageAnalysisSurvey) and [2022 survey paper](http://doi.org/10.1111/jmi.13229).
